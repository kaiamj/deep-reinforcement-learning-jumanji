1. bdrp.ipynb are the resources and basic implementation of jumanji and ppo seperately 

2. Random Policy is to check baseline performance of jumanji bin packing 

3. NN.ipynb is the implementation of Reinforcement learning model free algorithm PPO with jumanji bin packing

4. cleanrl_ppo_jax.ipynb is code from cleanrl repository 

## Next Step is to increase the speed of PPO(NN.ipynb) using jax to run billions of iterations fast and check distribution of output of Neural network (actor)
