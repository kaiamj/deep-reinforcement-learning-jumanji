1. PPO_jumaji_seperate_implementation.ipynb are the resources and implementation of jumanji and ppo seperately 

2. Random Policy is to check baseline performance of jumanji bin packing 

3. ProximalPolicyOptimization_PPO.ipynb is the implementation of Reinforcement learning model free algorithm PPO with jumanji bin packing

4. cleanrl_ppo_jax.ipynb is code from cleanrl repository, to translate our code into JAX

## Next Step is to increase the speed of PPO(NN.ipynb) using jax to run billions of iterations fast and check distribution of output of Neural network (actor)
